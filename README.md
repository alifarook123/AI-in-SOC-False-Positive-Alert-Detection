# AI-in-SOC-False-Positive-Alert-Detection
This project aims to use machine learning to automatically identify and filter false positives, thereby improving analyst efficiency, response time, and SOC productivity.
Objectives

Develop a model to classify SOC alerts as true or false positives.

Reduce alert noise and prioritize legitimate threats.

Improve Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Respond (MTTR) metrics.

Integrate with Elastic Securityâ€™s AI capabilities for automation and scalability.
